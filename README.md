# Special Fuel Volumes Distribution

### Project Overview
The project aims to enhance transparency by providing insights to comprehensive fuel consumption data, promoting accountability and data-driven decisions in the transportation sector.

### Data source
The data is sourced from monthly reports submitted by the States based on reports from suppliers and distributors.

### Tools used
- Python

### Analysis
- Checked the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, data types, and variable names.
- Analyzed the distribution of special fuel volumes over time comparing volumes across different states and identifying any seasonal patterns in fuel distribution.
- Visualized trends and patterns in fuel distribution over time (by year)
- Analyzed the distribution of special fuel volumes by state
- Sorted the states by volume of distribution to see the top contributors in each year (2020, 2021 and 2022)
- Visualized fuel distribution by State in every year (2020, 2021 and 2022)

### Results
