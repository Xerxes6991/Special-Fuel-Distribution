### Tools used
- Python

### Analysis
- Checked the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, data types, and variable names.
- Analyzed the distribution of special fuel volumes over time comparing volumes across different states and identifying any seasonal patterns in fuel distribution.
- Visualized trends and patterns in fuel distribution over time (by year)
- Analyzed the distribution of special fuel volumes by state
- Sorted the states by volume of distribution to see the top contributors in each year (2020, 2021 and 2022)
- Visualized fuel distribution by State in every year (2020, 2021 and 2022)

### Results
- The analysis shows the total volume of special fuel distributed each year, showing an increase from 2020 to 2021, followed by a slight decrease in 2022. This trend suggests a peak in special fuel distribution in 2021, with volumes finding its footing in the following year(2022)
